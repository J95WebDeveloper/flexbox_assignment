1. Justify-content  :  justify-content property defines how the browser distributes space between and around 
                       content items along the main axis of a flex container.


2. Align-items  :  align-items property in CSS is used to align flex items along the cross axis within a flexbox container.


3. Gap  :  gap property defines the size of the gap between rows and columns in a multi column layout flex container.


4. Flex-direction  :  flex-direction property sets how flex items are placed in the flex container defining 
                      the main axis and the direction (normal to reversed).


5. Flex-wrap :   flex-wrap property sets whether flex items are forced onto one line or can wrap onto multiple 
                 lines. If wrapping is allowed, it sets the direction that lines are stacked.
